# DiceChallange
roll the dice using Random Generator in JS
We are using classic Seperation of Concern properties along with document object model (DOM).

Working of project:

Using DOM we are adding behaviour on js file and making the change onto our HTML structure base on the results.
Specific function used in js is "Math.random()*6" to generate dice roll for 2 user
Based on the output of the dice roll using Math.random we can declare:
1. if player 1 is the winner
2. if player 2 is the winner
3. it is a draw

Please find the picture of results below;
